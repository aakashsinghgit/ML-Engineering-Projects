# Loan Criterion - Project Objective
This project is a **simple ML-powered web application** that predicts **loan approval** based on applicant details.

It serves as your **first step in ML Engineering**, demonstrating how to deploy a trained machine learning model using a Flask web app. Users enter information on a web page, and the app predicts whether they qualify for a loan.

While it showcases the foundational components of building a web application, its **primary goal is to demonstrate integrating a machine learning model as a core feature in a working web app**. This serves as a **template for deploying machine learning solutions in web environments**. Visit the main repo page for the full roadmap.

## Skills Covered

‚úÖ Train a classification model to predict loan approval (yes/no).  
‚úÖ Pickle the trained model for later inference.  
‚úÖ Build a Flask web app (with MYSQL and MongoDB) to serve the model for user input and display predictions.

## Features

- Collects user input via a web form
- Uses a pre-trained ML model (pickle file) for predictions
- Returns instant feedback ("Eligible"/"Not Eligible") on the web page

## Prerequisites and Setup

1. **Install MySQL Server**  
   Make sure MySQL Server is installed and running on your machine.  
   > The application connects to MySQL using the `root` user and expects the password you provide in your MySQL installation.   
   > **Note:** The MySQL root password used in the app must match the password set in `main.py` (see line 18; update this line with your actual root password if needed).
   > It will appear as below:
   ```
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://root:yourpass@localhost:3306/login_store'
   # replace 'yourpass' with your actual MySQL root password
   ```

2. **Install Python**  
   Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment for package management:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Ensure the model file exists**

Ensure `model.pkl` is inside the `root/` directory as shown in Project Structure.   
You can train a new model using 'Model_Building/' contents, which creates a model.pkl file on run. Export it to the 'root/' directory.

6. **Run the Application**  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.
