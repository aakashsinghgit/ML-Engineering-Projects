# ML Engineering Projects

Welcome to the **ML Engineering Projects** repository!  
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects, each designed as a standalone, few as starters, some focused on one concpet of ML Engineering, and few end-to-end production-grade solutions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project lives inside its own subfolder within this repository.  
This modular approach allows you to explore, develop, and deploy each project independently.

```
ML-Engineering-Projects/
├── project-1-name/
├── project-2-name/
├── README.md
└── ...
```

- **Each subfolder** contains all code, data, and resources required for that specific project.
- Projects may cover a variety of domains, such as healthcare, insurance, classification, regression, and topics related to ML such as MLOPS, MLFow, Dockrere etc. and can be comibantion of both and more.

## 🚀 Road Map 2025
# ML Engineering Learning Roadmap (Project-Based)

This roadmap will guide your **practical, project-driven journey to become an ML Engineer**, moving from beginner-friendly projects to full production-grade pipelines with MLOps best practices.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Model + App)

### 🚩 Project 1: Loan Predictor

* Train a simple ML model in Jupyter.
* Serve using a **Flask app**.
* Pickle the model and load during inference.

---

## Phase 2: Modular Project Structure

### 🚩 Project 2: Health Insurance Price Prediction

* Modular structure:

  * src/components
  * utils
  * logger
  * exception handler
  * config.yaml
* Pickle + load model for serving.
* Add **basic CI/CD pipeline** using Github Actions.
* Dockerize app for local reproducibility.

---

## Phase 3: Experiment Tracking & Pipelines

### 🚩 Project 3: MLflow Tracking

* Integrate **MLflow or Weights & Biases** for experiment tracking.
* Model registry + version control.

### 🚩 Project 4: Data Pipelines

* Create ETL pipeline for ingestion, validation, cleaning.
* Integrate **feature engineering pipeline**.
* Use Great Expectations or whylogs for data validation.

---

## Phase 4: Serving & Deployment

### 🚩 Project 5: FastAPI Model Serving

* Replace Flask with **FastAPI** for async, faster inference.
* Serve model with REST endpoints + OpenAPI docs.
* Containerize using Docker.

### 🚩 Project 6: Kubernetes Deployment

* Deploy FastAPI Docker container on **Kubernetes cluster (local/minikube or GCP/Azure)**.
* Learn about auto-scaling and rolling updates.

---

## Phase 5: MLOps & Monitoring

### 🚩 Project 7: CI/CD Automation

* Automate model retraining pipeline with Github Actions.
* Automate Docker builds and deployment on push.
* Push new models to model registry on passing tests.

### 🚩 Project 8: Monitoring & Drift Detection

* Integrate drift monitoring and alerting.
* Log model input/output, latency, and metrics.
* Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring (optional).

---

## Phase 6: End-to-End Production Systems (Capstones)

### 🚩 Project 9: E-commerce Recommender System

* Use modular pipelines for data ingestion, training, serving.
* Use MLflow for experiment tracking + model registry.
* Containerized deployment with CI/CD.
* Integrated monitoring.

### 🚩 Project 10: Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

* Build a streaming pipeline using Kafka.
* Serve models for near real-time inference.
* Focus on system design trade-offs: latency, cost, retraining.

## Additional Skills to Integrate Throughout

✅ **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests for data & model pipelines.
✅ **System Design Thinking:** Document architecture diagrams for each project.
✅ **Feature Stores:** Learn tools like Feast for advanced feature management.
✅ **Explainability:** SHAP or LIME for monitoring and debugging models.
✅ **Documentation:** Maintain clean README and docstrings for every project.
