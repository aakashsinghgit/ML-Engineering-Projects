# ML Engineering Projects

Welcome to the **ML Engineering Projects** repository!  
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects, each designed as a standalone, few as starters, some focused on one concpet of ML Engineering, and few end-to-end production-grade solutions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project lives inside its own subfolder within this repository.  
This modular approach allows you to explore, develop, and deploy each project independently.

```
ML-Engineering-Projects/
├── project-1-name/
├── project-2-name/
├── README.md
└── ...
```

- **Each subfolder** contains all code, data, and resources required for that specific project.
- Projects may cover a variety of domains, such as healthcare, insurance, classification, regression, and topics related to ML such as MLOPS, MLFow, Dockrere etc. and can be comibantion of both and more.

## 🚀 Projects Included

- **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction:**  
  Predict medical insurance costs using regression models and feature engineering.
- **[Add your next project name here]**  
  Short description of the project.

*(Add or update the list above as new projects are added!)*
