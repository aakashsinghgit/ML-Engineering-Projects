# ML Engineering Projects

Welcome to the **ML Engineering Projects** repository! 🚀

This repository contains a structured collection of **hands-on, project-based implementations to learn and practice ML Engineering systematically**. Projects range from beginner-friendly starter applications to modular pipelines, MLOps practices, and end-to-end production-grade systems.

These projects are designed to help you **build, deploy, monitor, and iterate on machine learning systems in realistic workflows**, moving beyond notebooks to fully operational ML pipelines and services.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project lives inside its own subfolder within this repository, ensuring modularity and independent exploration.
```
ML-Engineering-Projects/Projects/
├── P1-loan-predictor/
├── P2-health-insurance-predictor/
├── ...
└── README.md
```
✅ **Each subfolder** contains code, data, and resources for that project.  
✅ Projects cover domains such as healthcare, insurance, finance, e-commerce, and applied ML engineering tools like MLflow, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## 🚀 Road Map 2025

# ML Engineering Learning Roadmap (Project-Based)

This roadmap is the guide to **practical, project-driven journey to become an ML Engineer**, progressing from foundational projects to advanced, production-ready MLOps pipelines.

---

## Phase 1: Get started (Model + App)

### 🚩 Project 1: Loan Predictor
**Name:** Loan Predictor App

* Train a simple ML model in Jupyter Notebook.
* Serve using a basic **Flask app**.
* Pickle the model and load during inference.

---

## Phase 2: Modular Project Structure

### 🚩 Project 2: Health Insurance Price Prediction
**Name:** Health Insurance Price Predictor

* Intro to Modular structure with logging, exception handling, components and pipelines.
* Pickle + load model for serving.
* Add **basic CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions.
* Dockerize app for local reproducibility.

---

## Phase 3: Experiment Tracking & Pipelines

### 🚩 Project 3: MLflow Tracking
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Integrate **MLflow or Weights & Biases** for experiment tracking.
* Model registry + version control.

### 🚩 Project 4: Data Pipelines
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Create ETL pipeline for ingestion, validation, and cleaning.
* Integrate **feature engineering pipeline**.
* Use Great Expectations or whylogs for data validation.

---

## Phase 4: Serving & Deployment

### 🚩 Project 5: FastAPI Model Serving
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Replace Flask with **FastAPI** for async, faster inference.
* Serve model with REST endpoints + OpenAPI docs.
* Containerize using Docker.

### 🚩 Project 6: Kubernetes Deployment
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Deploy FastAPI Docker container on **Kubernetes cluster (local/minikube or GCP/Azure)**.
* Learn about auto-scaling and rolling updates.

---

## Phase 5: MLOps & Monitoring

### 🚩 Project 7: CI/CD Automation
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Automate model retraining pipeline with GitHub Actions.
* Automate Docker builds and deployment on push.
* Push new models to model registry on passing tests.

### 🚩 Project 8: Monitoring & Drift Detection
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Integrate drift monitoring and alerting.
* Log model input/output, latency, and metrics.
* Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring (optional).

---

## Phase 6: End-to-End Production Systems (Capstones)

### 🚩 Project 9: E-commerce Recommender System
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Use modular pipelines for data ingestion, training, serving.
* Use MLflow for experiment tracking + model registry.
* Containerized deployment with CI/CD.
* Integrated monitoring.

### 🚩 Project 10: Real-Time Streaming Pipeline
**Name:** _(To be added)_

* Build a streaming pipeline using Kafka.
* Serve models for near real-time inference.
* Focus on system design trade-offs: latency, cost, retraining.

---

## Additional Skills to Integrate Throughout

✅ **Testing:** Unit and integration tests for data and model pipelines.  
✅ **System Design Thinking:** Document architecture diagrams for each project.                         
✅ **Feature Stores:** Learn tools like Feast for advanced feature management.  
✅ **Explainability:** SHAP or LIME for monitoring and debugging models.  
✅ **Documentation:** Maintain clean README and docstrings for every project.
